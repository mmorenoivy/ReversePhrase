String Phrase Reversal Challenge
 
Write an application that will take any given string as input and will output the reverse order of the string phrase. 
 
"Hello World" becomes "World Hello" and "Everybody Wants To Rule The World" becomes "World The Rule To Wants Everybody".
 
Punctuation should not be altered and should remain in place. 
For example, "Hello World!" would become "World Hello!"
"Everybody wants, to rule the world?" should become "world the, rule to wants Everybody?"
